The profile describes how an ID Token is used to get a JWT Authorization Grant and then to get an Access Token for that JWT Authorization Grant. The scope can be defined by the client when requesting the access token.\r\n\r\nAs the JWT Authorization Grant profile is designed to allow interop across several domains, each AS in the participating domain will support creating authorization grant JWTs as well as accepting authorization grant JWTs to issue access tokens.\r\n\r\nUsually a client receives an access token alongside the ID Token and the client can use Token Exchange to get additional access tokens with equal or narrowed down scope.\r\n\r\nThe ID Token does not contain any scope. So even if a client only received an Access Token with a specific narrow scope, the client could abuse this grant by asking AS of domain A for an authorization grant JWT based on the Id Token and then use this authz grant JWT at the AS of domain A again to obtain a new access token with arbitrary scope (up to what is allowed for the client as per policy).\r\n\r\nAlthough this could be prohibited by the AS not accepting authorization grant JWTs it issued itself, the client could request the authorization grant JWT from the AS of domain B with just a couple more steps.\r\n\r\nGranted, this may not be relevant for the enterprise environment the JWT authorization grant profile is meant for as the End-User is usually not asked for giving consent to the scope requested by clients and instead the allowed scope in defined by policies within the AS configs.

In doing that,  step 3 is fine because right now clients already are registered with the RS AS to request tokens directly and facilitate SSO flows. We wanted to lean into that by shifting as much of the burden to the identity provider, especially since the identity provider has all of the information about the user/organization and their relationships.\r\n\r\nI do like the simplicity of the proposed modified scenario and I think we should continue hammering out details to see if this kind of approach could work.\r\n\r\nI think we also agree that front loading the `client_id` and `resource` identifiers for mapping on the identity provider is not ideal. Unfortunately, I also believe requiring the IdP to register a client on every RS AS to do a new on-behalf exchange is not ideal either, especially since that is technically 3rd party to the existing client and AS oAuth registration/trust relationship.",

For the refresh token, the the approach from the previous point could be used but this is more complex for the access token.\r\n* The IdP would have to forward (and possibly filter/translate) many parameters such as scope, etc.\r\n* The client would not have the AS server metadata as it would not have a direct relationship with the AS.\r\n* DPoP forwarding would not work.",

Curious on other's thoughts there.\r\n\r\n",
