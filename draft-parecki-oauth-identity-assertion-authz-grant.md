--- abstract

This specification provides a mechanism for an application to use an identity assertion to obtain an access token for a third-party API using Token Exchange {{RFC8693}} and JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Grants {{RFC7523}}.

--- middle

# Introduction

The draft specification Identity Chaining Across Trust Domains {{I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining}} defines how to request a JWT authorization grant from an Authorization Server and exchange it for an Access Token at another Authorization Server in a different trust domain. The specification is an application of a combination of OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange {{RFC8693}} and JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants {{RFC7523}}. The draft supports multiple different use cases by leaving many details of the token exchange request and JWT authorization grant unspecified.

This specification defines the additional details necessary to support interoperable implementations when using identity tokens as the input to the token exchange request. This specification assumes that there is a single authorization server that is trusted by two applications in different trust domains, as typically found in an enterprise scenario where the two applications allow users to log in using the same enterprise identity provider. The same enterprise identity provider that is trusted by applications for single sign-on can be extended to broker access to APIs as well.


# Conventions and Definitions

## Roles

Client
: Application that wants to obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token on behalf of a signed-in user to an external/3rd party application's API (Resource Server below). In {{I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining}}, this is the Client in trust domain A.

Resource Application
: Application that provides an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource. In {{I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining}}, this is the Protected Resource in trust domain B.

Authorization Server (IdP)
: The Identity Provider that is trusted by a set of applications in an organization's app ecosystem. In {{I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining}}, this is the Authorization Server in trust domain A, which is also trusted by the Authorization Server of the Protected Resource in trust domain B.

# Overview

The example flow is for an enterprise `acme`, which uses a wiki app and chat app from different vendors, both of which are integrated into the enterprise's Identity Provider using OpenID Connect.

| Role     | App URL | Tenant URL   | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Client | `https://wiki.example` | `https://acme.wiki.example` | Wiki app that embeds content from one or more resource applications |
| Resource Application   | `https://chat.example` | `https://acme.chat.example` | Chat and communication app |
| Identity Provider      | `https://idp.example`   | `https://acme.idp.example` | Identity Provider |

1. User logs in to the Client, the Client obtains the Identity Assertion (e.g. OpenID Connect ID Token or SAML assertion)
2. Client uses the Identity Assertion to request an Identity Assertion Authorization Grant for the Resource Application from the IdP
3. Client exchanges the Identity Assertion Authorization Grant JWT for an Access Token at the Resource Application's token endpoint
4. Client makes an API request with the Access Token

This specification is constrained to deployments where all Resource Application Resource Servers are leveraging the same IdP Authorization Server for Single-Sign-On (SSO) and session management services. The IdP provides a consistent trust boundary enabling the set of Resource Application Authorization Servers to honor the JWT Authorization Grant (ID-JAG) issued by the IdP. This specification also assumes that the Resource Server Authorization Servers delegate user authorization authority to the IdP (e.g. the IdP is trusted to ensure the scopes identified in the ID-JAG have been correctly authorized before issuing the ID-JAG token).


# User Authentication

The Client initiates an authentication request with the IdP using OpenID Connect or SAML.

The following is an example using OpenID Connect

    302 Redirect
    Location: https://acme.idp.example/authorize?response_type=code&scope=openid&client_id=...

The user authenticates with the IdP, and is redirected back to the Client with an authorization code, which it can then exchange for an ID Token.

Note: The Enterprise IdP may enforce security controls such as multi-factor authentication before granting the user access to the Client.

    POST /token HTTP/1.1
    Host: acme.idp.example
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    grant_type=authorization_code
    &code=.....

    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "id_token": "eyJraWQiOiJzMTZ0cVNtODhwREo4VGZCXzdrSEtQ...",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "access_token": "7SliwCQP1brGdjBtsaMnXo",
      "scope": "openid"
    }


# Token Exchange

The Client makes a Token Exchange {{RFC8693}} request to the IdP's Token Endpoint with the following parameters:

`requested_token_type`:
: REQUIRED - The value `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag` indicates that an ID Assertion JWT is being requested.

`resource`:
: REQUIRED - The Issuer URL of the Resource Application's authorization server.

`audience`:
: The audience parameter MUST NOT be used to indicate the authorization server.

`scope`:
: OPTIONAL - The space-separated list of scopes at the Resource Application that is being requested.

`subject_token`:
: REQUIRED - The identity assertion (e.g. the OpenID Connect ID Token or SAML assertion) for the target end-user.

`subject_token_type`:
: REQUIRED - An identifier, as described in Section 3 of {{RFC8693}}, that indicates the type of the security token in the `subject_token` parameter. For an OpenID Connect ID Token: `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token`, or for a SAML assertion: `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2`.

The additional parameters defined in Section 2.1 of {{RFC8693}} `actor_token` and `actor_token_type` are not used in this specification.

Client authentication to the authorization server is done using the standard mechanisms provided by OAuth 2.0. Section 2.3.1 of {{RFC6749}} defines password-based authentication of the client (`client_id` and `client_secret`), however, client authentication is extensible and other mechanisms are possible. For example, {{RFC7523}} defines client authentication using bearer JSON Web Tokens using `client_assertion` and `client_assertion_type`.

The example below uses an ID Token as the Identity Assertion, and uses a JWT Bearer Assertion ({{RFC7523}}) as the client authentication method, (tokens truncated for brevity):

    POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: acme.idp.example
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
    &requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag
    &resource=https://acme.chat.example/
    &scope=chat.read+chat.history
    &subject_token=eyJraWQiOiJzMTZ0cVNtODhwREo4VGZCXzdrSEtQ...
    &subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token
    &client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer
    &client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjIyIn0...

## Processing Rules

The IdP MUST validate the subject token, and MUST validate that the audience of the Subject Token (e.g. the `aud` claim of the ID Token) matches the `client_id` of the client authentication of the request.

The IdP evaluates administrator-defined policy for the token exchange request and determines if the client should be granted access to act on behalf of the subject for the target audience and scopes.

The IdP may also introspect the authentication context described in the SSO assertion to determine if step-up authentication is required.

## Response

If access is granted, the IdP creates a signed Identity Assertion Authorization Grant JWT and returns it in the token exchange response defined in Section 2.2 of {{RFC8693}}:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    Cache-Control: no-store
    Pragma: no-cache

    {
      "issued_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag",
      "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI...",
      "token_type": "N_A",
      "scope": "chat.read chat.history",
      "expires_in": 300
    }

`issued_token_type`:
: REQUIRED - `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag`

`access_token`:
: REQUIRED - The Identity Assertion Authorization Grant JWT. (Note: Token Exchange requires the `access_token` response parameter for historical reasons, even though this is not an OAuth access token.)

`token_type`:
: REQUIRED - `N_A` (because this is not an OAuth access token.)

`scope`:
: OPTIONAL if the scope of the issued token is identical to the scope requested by the client; otherwise, it is REQUIRED. This may be fewer scopes than the application requested based on various policies in the IdP.

`expires_in`:
: RECOMMENDED - The lifetime in seconds of the authorization grant.

`refresh_token`:
: OPTIONAL according to Section 2.2 of {{RFC8693}}. In the context of this specification, this parameter SHOULD NOT be used.


### Error Response

On an error condition, the IdP returns an OAuth 2.0 Token Error response as defined in Section 5.2 of {{RFC6749}}, e.g:

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json
    Cache-Control: no-store

    {
      "error": "invalid_grant",
      "error_description": "Audience validation failed"
    }


## Identity Assertion Authorization Grant JWT {#jwt-authorization-grant}

The Identity Assertion Authorization Grant JWT is issued and signed by the IdP, and describes the intended audience of the authorization grant as well as the client to which it was issued and the subject identifier of the resource owner, using the following claims:

`iss`:
: REQUIRED - The IdP `issuer` URL as defined in Section 4.1.1 of {{RFC7519}}

`sub`:
: REQUIRED - The subject identifier (e.g. user ID) of the resource owner at the Resource Application as defined in Section 4.1.2 of {{RFC7519}}

`aud`:
: REQUIRED - The Issuer URL of the Resource Application's authorization server as defined in Section 4.1.3 of {{RFC7519}}

`client_id`:
: REQUIRED - An identifier of the client that this JWT was issued to, which MUST be recognized by the Resource Application's authorization server. For interoperability, the client identifier SHOULD be a `client_id` as defined in Section 4.3 {{RFC8693}}.

`jti`:
: REQUIRED - Unique ID of this JWT as defined in Section 4.1.7 of {{RFC7519}}

`exp`:
: REQUIRED - as defined in Section 4.1.4 of {{RFC7519}}

`iat`:
: REQUIRED - as defined in Section 4.1.6 of {{RFC7519}}

`scope`:
: OPTIONAL - a JSON string containing a space-separated list of scopes associated with the token, in the format described in Section 3.3 of {{RFC6749}}

The `typ` of the JWT indicated in the JWT header MUST be `oauth-id-jag+jwt`.

An example JWT shown with expanded header and payload claims is below:

    {
      "typ": "oauth-id-jag+jwt"
    }
    .
    {
      "jti": "9e43f81b64a33f20116179",
      "iss": "https://acme.idp.example",
      "sub": "U019488227",
      "aud": "https://acme.chat.example/",
      "client_id": "f53f191f9311af35",
      "exp": 1311281970,
      "iat": 1311280970,
      "scope": "chat.read chat.history"
    }
    .
    signature

The authorization server MAY add additional claims as necessary.

Implementation notes:

* If the IdP is multi-tenant and uses the same `issuer` for all tenants, the Resource Application will already have IdP-specific logic to determine the tenant from the OpenID Connect ID Token (e.g. the `hd` claim in Google) or SAML assertion, and will need to use that if the IdP also has only one client registration for the Resource Application.
* `sub` should be an opaque ID, as `iss`+`sub` is unique. The IdP might want to also include the user's email here, which it should do as a new `email` claim. This would let the app dedupe existing users who may have an account with an email address but have not done SSO yet.


# Access Token Request {#token-request}

The Client makes an access token request to the Resource Application's token endpoint using the previously obtained Identity Assertion Authorization Grant as a JWT Assertion as defined by {{RFC7523}}.

`grant_type`:
: REQUIRED - The value of `grant_type` is `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`

`assertion`:
: REQUIRED - The Identity Assertion Authorization Grant JWT obtained in the previous token exchange step

The Client authenticates with its credentials as registered with the Resource Application's authorization server.

For example:

    POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: acme.chat.example
    Authorization: Basic yZS1yYW5kb20tc2VjcmV0v3JOkF0XG5Qx2

    grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
    assertion=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI...


## Processing Rules

All of Section 5.2 of {{RFC7521}} applies, in addition to the following processing rules:

* Validate the JWT `typ` is `oauth-id-jag+jwt` (per {{RFC8725}})
* The `aud` claim MUST identify the Issuer URL of the Resource Application's authorization server as the intended audience of the JWT.
* The `client_id` claim MUST identify the same client as the client authentication in the request.


## Response

The Resource Application token endpoint responds with an OAuth 2.0 Token Response, e.g.:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
    Cache-Control: no-store
    Pragma: no-cache

    {
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "access_token": "2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
      "expires_in": 86400,
      "scope": "chat.read chat.history",
      "refresh_token": "tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA",
    }


# Security Considerations

## Client Authentication

This specification SHOULD only be supported for confidential clients.  Public clients SHOULD redirect the user with an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request.

## Step-Up Authentication

In the initial token exchange request, the IdP may require step-up authentication for the subject if the authentication context in the subject's assertion does not meet policy requirements. An `insufficient_user_authentication` OAuth error response may be returned to convey the authentication requirements back to the client similar to OAuth 2.0 Step-up Authentication Challenge Protocol {{RFC9470}}.


    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json
    Cache-Control: no-store

    {
      "error": "insufficient_user_authentication",
      "error_description": "Subject doesn't meet authentication requirements",
      "max_age": 5
    }


The Client would need to redirect the user back to the IdP to obtain a new assertion that meets the requirements and retry the token exchange.

TBD: It may make more sense to request the Identity Assertion Authorization Grant as an additional `response_type` on the authorization request if using OIDC for SSO when performing a step-up to skip the need for additional token exchange round-trip.

## Cross-Domain Use

This specification is intended for cross-domain uses where the Client, Resource App, and Identity Provider are all in different trust domains. In particular, the Identity Provider SHOULD NOT issue access tokens in response to an ID-JAG it issued itself. Doing so could lead to unintentional broadening of the scope of authorization.


# IANA Considerations

## Media Types

This section registers `oauth-id-jag+jwt`, a new media type {{RFC2046}} in the "Media Types" registry {{IANA.MediaTypes}} in the manner described in {{RFC6838}}. It can be used to indicate that the content is a Identity Assertion Authorization Grant JWT.


## OAuth URI Registration

This section registers `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag` in the "OAuth URI" subregistry of the "OAuth Parameters" registry {{IANA.oauth-parameters}}.

* URN: urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag
* Common Name: Token type URI for a Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant
* Change Controller: IESG
* Specification Document: This document

# Use Cases

## Enterprise Deployment

Enterprises often have hundreds of SaaS applications.  SaaS applications often have integrations to other SaaS applications that are critical to the application experience and jobs to be done.  When a SaaS app needs to request an access token on behalf of a user to a 3rd party SaaS integration's API, the end-user typically needs to complete an interactive delegated OAuth 2.0 flow, as the SaaS application is not in the same security or policy domain as the 3rd party SaaS integration.

It is industry best practice for an enterprise to connect their ecosystem of SaaS applications to their Identity Provider (IdP) to centralize identity and access management capabilites for the organization.  End-users get a better experience (SSO) and administrators get better security outcomes such multi-factor authentication and zero-trust.  SaaS applications today enable the administrator to establish trust with an IdP for user authentication.

This specification can be used to extend the SSO relationship of multiple SaaS applications to include API access between these applications as well. This specification enables federation for Authorization Servers across policy or administrative boundaries. The same enterprise IdP that is trusted by applications for SSO can be extended to broker access to APIs.  This enables the enterprise to centralize more access decisions across their SaaS ecosystem and provides better end-user experience for users that need to connect multiple applications via OAuth 2.0.

### Preconditions

* The Client has a registered OAuth 2.0 Client with the IdP Authorization Server
* The Client has a registered OAuth 2.0 Client with the Resource Application
* Enterprise has established a trust relationship between their IdP and the Client for SSO and Identity Assertion Authorization Grant
* Enterprise has established a trust relationship between their IdP and the Resource Application for SSO and Identity Assertion Authorization Grant
* Enterprise has granted the Client permission to act on behalf of users for the Resource Application with a set of scopes

## Email and Calendaring Applications

Email clients can be used with arbitrary email servers, and cannot require pre-established relationships between each email client and each email server. When an email client uses OAuth to obtain an access token to an email server, this provides the security benefit of being able to use strong multi-factor authentication methods provided by the email server's authorization server, but does require that the user go through a web-based flow to log in to the email client. However, this web-based flow is often seen as distruptive to the user experience when initiated from a desktop or mobile native application, and so is often attempted to be minimized as much as possible.

When the email client needs access to a separate API, such as a third-party calendaring application, traditionally this would require that the email client go through another web-based OAuth redirect flow to obtain authorization and ultimately an access token.

To streamline the user experience, this specification can be used to enable the email client to use the identity assertion to obtain an access token for the third-party calendaring application without any user interaction.

### Preconditions

* The Client does not have a pre-registered OAuth 2.0 client at the IdP Authorization Server or the Resource Application
* The Client has obtained an Identity Assertion (e.g. ID Token) from the IdP Authorization Server
* The Resource Application is configured to allow the Identity Assertion Authorization Grant from unregistered clients

## LLM Agent using Enterprise Tools

AI agents, including those based on large language models (LLMs), are designed to manage user context, memory, and interaction state across multi-turn conversations. To perform complex tasks, these agents often integrate with external systems such as SaaS applications, internal services, or enterprise data sources. When accessing these systems, the agent operates on behalf of the end user, and its actions are constrained by the user’s identity, role, and permissions as defined by the enterprise. This ensures that all data access and operations are properly scoped and compliant with organizational access controls.

### Preconditions

* The LLM Agent has a registered OAuth 2.0 Client (`com.example.ai-agent`) with the Enterprise IdP (`cyberdyne.idp.example`)
* The LLM Agent has a registered OAuth 2.0 Client (`4960880b83dc9`) with the External Tool Application (`saas.example.net`)
* Enterprise has established a trust relationship between their IdP and the LLM Agent for SSO
* Enterprise has established a trust relationship between their IdP and the External Tool Application for SSO and Identity Assertion Authorization Grant
* Enterprise has granted the LLM Agent permission to act on behalf of users for the External Tool Application with a specific set of scopes

### LLM Agent establishes a User Identity with Enterprise IdP

LLM Agent discovers the Enterprise IdP's OpenID Connect Provider configuration based on a configured `issuer` that was previously establshed.

> Note: IdP discovery where an agent discovers which IdP the agent should use to authenticate a given user is out of scope of this specification.

    GET /.well-known/openid-configuration
    Host: cyberdyne.idp.example
    Accept: application/json

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "issuer": "https://cyberdyne.idp.example",
      "authorization_endpoint": "https://cyberdyne.idp.example/oauth2/authorize",
      "token_endpoint": "https://cyberdyne.idp.example/oauth2/token",
      "userinfo_endpoint": "https://cyberdyne.idp.example/oauth2/userinfo",
      "jwks_uri": "https://cyberdyne.idp.example/oauth2/keys",
      "registration_endpoint": "https://cyberdyne.idp.example/oauth2/register",
      "scopes_supported": [
        "openid", "email", "profile"
      ],
      "response_types_supported": [
        "code"
      ],
      "grant_types_supported": [
        "authorization_code", "refresh_token", "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange"
      ],
      ...
    }

LLM Agent discovers all necessary endpoints for authentication as well as support for the Token Exchange grant type `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange`

> Note: Token Exchange {{RFC8693}} doesn't define an authorization server metadata parameter for `requested_token_types_supported` to discover if `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag` is specifically supported. Currently, the LLM Agent needs to first attempt Token Exchange to learn if the specific Enterprise IdP supports issuing an Identity Assertion Grant. This specification could define an Authorization Server Metadata {{RFC8414}} parameter to enable the agent to discover if this request is supported. See [issue #16](https://github.com/aaronpk/draft-parecki-oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant/issues/16).

### IdP Authorization Request (with PKCE)

LLM Agent generates a PKCE `code_verifier` and a `code_challenge` (usually a SHA256 hash of the verifier, base64url-encoded) and redirects the end-user to the Enterprise IdP with an authorization request

    GET /authorize?
      response_type=code
      &client_id=com.example.ai-agent
      &redirect_uri=https://ai-agent.example.com/oauth2/callback
      &scope=openid+profile+email
      &state=xyzABC123
      &code_challenge=E9Melhoa2OwvFrEMTJguCHaoeK1t8URWbuGJSstw-cM
      &code_challenge_method=S256
    Host: cyberdyne.idp.example

### User authenticates and authorizes LLM Agent

Enterprise IdP authenticates the end-user and redirects back to the LLM Agent's registered client redirect URI with an authorization code:

    https://ai-agent.example.com/oauth2/callback?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA&state=xyzABC123

LLM Agent exchanges the `code` and PKCE `code_verifier` to obtain an ID Token and Access Token for the IdP's UserInfo endpoint

    POST /oauth2/token
    Host: cyberdyne.idp.example
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    grant_type=authorization_code
    &code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
    &redirect_uri=https://ai-agent.example.com/oauth2/callback
    &client_id=com.example.ai-agent
    &code_verifier=dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk

    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "id_token": "eyJraWQiOiJzMTZ0cVNtODhwREo4VGZCXzdrSEtQ...",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "access_token": "7SliwCQP1brGdjBtsaMnXo",
      "scope": "openid profile email"
    }

LLM Agent validates the ID Token using the published JWKS for the IdP

    {
      "iss": "https://cyberdyne.idp.example",
      "sub": "1997e829-2029-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "aud": "com.example.ai-agent",
      "exp": 1984444800,
      "iat": 1684441200,
      "auth_time": 1684440000,
      "name": "John Connor",
      "email": "john.connor@cyberdyne.example",
      "email_verified": true
    }

LLM Agent now has an identity binding for context

### LLM Agent calls Enterprise External Tool

LLM Agent tool calls an external tool provided by an Enterprise SaaS Application (Resource Server) without a valid access token and is issued an authentication challenge using {{I-D.ietf-oauth-resource-metadata}}

> Note: How agents discover available tools is out of scope of this specification

    GET /tools
    Host: saas.example.net
    Accept: application/json

    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=
      "https://saas.example.net/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource"

LLM Agent fetches the external tool resource's `OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata` per {{I-D.ietf-oauth-resource-metadata}} to dynamically discover an authorization server that can issue an access token for the resource.

    GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
    Host: saas.example.net
    Accept: application/json

    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
       "resource":
         "https://saas.example.net/",
       "authorization_servers":
         [ "https://authorization-server.saas.com" ],
       "bearer_methods_supported":
         ["header", "body"],
       "scopes_supported":
         ["agent.tools.read", "agent.tools.write"],
       "resource_documentation":
         "https://saas.example.net/tools/resource_documentation.html"
     }

LLM Agent discovers the Authorization Server configuration per {{RFC8414}}

    GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
    Host: authorization-server.saas.com
    Accept: application/json

    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "issuer": "https://authorization-server.saas.com",
      "authorization_endpoint": "https://authorization-server.saas.com/oauth2/authorize",
      "token_endpoint": "https://authorization-server.saas.com/oauth2/token",
      "jwks_uri": "https://authorization-server.saas.com/oauth2/keys",
      "registration_endpoint": "authorization-server.saas.com/oauth2/register",
      "scopes_supported": [
        "agent.read", "agent.write"
      ],
      "response_types_supported": [
        "code"
      ],
      "grant_types_supported": [
        "authorization_code", "refresh_token", "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer"
      ],
      ...
    }

LLM Agent has learned all necessary endpoints and supported capabilites to obtain an access token for the external tool.

If the `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` grant type is supported the LLM can first attempt to silently obtain an access token using an Identity Assertion Authorization Grant from the Enterprise's IdP otherwise it can fallback to interactively obtaining a standard `authorization_code` from the SaaS Application's Authorization Server

> Note: This would benefit from an Authorization Server Metadata {{RFC8414}} property to indicate whether the Identity Assertion Authorization Grant form of `jwt-bearer` would be accepted by this authorization server. There are other uses of `jwt-bearer` that may be supported by the authorization server as well, and is not necessarily a reliable indication that the Identity Assertion Authorization Grant would be supported. See [issue #16](https://github.com/aaronpk/draft-parecki-oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant/issues/16).

### LLM Agent obtains an Identity Assertion Grant for Enterprise External Tool from the Enterprise IdP

LLM Agent makes an Identity Assertion Grant Token Exchange {{RFC8693}} request for the external tool's resource from the user's Enterprise IdP using the ID Token the LLM Agent obtained when establishing an identity binding context along with scopes and the resource identifier for the external tool that was returned in the tool's `OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata`

    POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: cyberdyne.idp.example
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
    &requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag
    &resource=https://saas.example.net/
    &scope=agent.read+agent.write
    &subject_token=eyJraWQiOiJzMTZ0cVNtODhwREo4VGZCXzdrSEtQ...
    &subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token
    &client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer
    &client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjIyIn0...

If access is granted, the Enterprise IdP creates a signed Identity Assertion Authorization Grant JWT and returns it in the token exchange response defined in Section 2.2 of {{RFC8693}}:

### LLM Agent obtains an Access Token for Enterprise External Tool

LLM Agent makes a token request to the previously discovered external tool's Authorization Server token endpoint using the Identity Assertion Authorization Grant obtained from the Enterprise IdP as a JWT Assertion as defined by {{RFC7523}}.

The LLM Agent authenticates with its client credentials that were registered with the SaaS Authorization Server

> Note: How the LLM Agent registers with the Authorization Server (e.g static or dynamic client registration), and whether or not it has credentials, is out-of-scope of this specification

    POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: authorization-server.saas.com
    Authorization: Basic yZS1yYW5kb20tc2VjcmV0v3JOkF0XG5Qx2

    grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
    assertion=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI...

SaaS Authorization Server validates the Identity Assertion Authorization Grant using the published JWKS for the trusted Enterprise IdP

### LLM Agent makes an authorized External Tool request

LLM Agent tool calls an external tool provided by the Enterprise SaaS Application (Resource Server) with a valid access token

    GET /tools
    Host: saas.example.net
    Authorization: Bearer 2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA"
